# How to Use the Tool:
```
Note that for now this app is only set up to work with Unix based systems (MacOS and Linux).
Sorry in advance! ðŸ˜•
```
1. Download the zipped version of the project folder and Google Chrome if you don't already have it...

 ---> [download arts_webscraper.zip]()
 ---> [download Google Chrome]()

2. Go to your downloads folder and double click the arts_webscraper.zip file to uncompress it.
3. Open the folder and **double click the arts_webscraper.command file to start** the application.

## If you encounter an issue...
1. If you get a popup after you double-click the application file about permissions need to be changed, open up your Terminal application (hit command + space, then type "Terminal", then hit enter).
2. Then paste the following code into your command line...
```
chmod u+x ~/Downloads/arts_webscraper/arts_webscraper.command
```
3. This will let the computer know you want to be able to open the app directly.
4. If you're a regular Terminal user make sure that file path there makes sense.
5. You can also open the file directly through Terminal with this command...
```
bash ~/Downloads/arts_webscraper/arts_webscraper.command
```
6. If it still wont open for some reason give up and forget any of this ever happened, this tool is still under construction!
7. **Please let me know if you have any trouble** so I can fix it!..

```
## As it's opening up...
1. Before starting the application will check to see if you have access to the following tools...
```
â€¢ python3 â€“â€“ pre-installed on most Macs
â€¢ chromedriver â€“â€“ an extension to connect to the webscraper
â€¢ webdriver â€“â€“ to connect python to the web browser
```
2. You might be asked for your main password if needed during these downloads.
3. If you already have these set up you can directly open the application in Terminal...
```
python3 ~/Downloads/arts_dataexplorer/frontend.py
```

## Once you've got the application open...
1. Enter a city and watch it go!
2. In this less-than-perfect version of the tool you have to let it finish.
3. Once it finishes it will output a data file (.csv) that will contain all the galleries in your input city.
4. You can import this into excel to expore it.
```
Thanks for checking out the tool, hope it helps you do something cool! ðŸŽ‰
